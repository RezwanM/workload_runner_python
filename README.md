# workload_runner_python

The goal of this project was to create a validation tool that can automatically create and execute random, reproducible, and concurrent tests once launched. The tool - *Workload-Runner* - is meant to be accompanied by multiple OS applications (i.e., workloads) which can be used to stress the different IPs of the system. The project was intended to provide a glimpse of the true power of an automated validation framework, and for that reason it employs very simple workloads for demonstration purposes.  

This project was written in Python and Bash.
